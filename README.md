# GeoHarbour

GeoHarbour is a geospatial ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project designed to streamline and enhance the processing of geospatial data. Whether you're dealing with geographic information systems, mapping, or spatial analysis, GeoHarbour provides a robust solution for managing, transforming, and loading geospatial datasets.

## Features

- **GeoServer Interaction:** Retrieve and analyze layer information from GeoServer using the power of Rust and WebAssembly.
- **Web Feature Service (WFS) Integration:** Effortlessly fetch and process features from Web Feature Services, converting them to convenient GeoJSON format.
- **GMLH to GeoJSON Conversion:** Convert Google Maps Location History (GMLH) data to GeoJSON, simplifying the manipulation of latitude and longitude coordinates.
- **Grid Interpolation:** Utilize powerful interpolation techniques to predict and visualize bathymetry values on a grid, facilitating accurate spatial analysis.
- **Raster Operations:** Merge, manipulate, and analyze raster data with ease using the integrated Rust and WebAssembly capabilities.
- **Vectorization:** Convert raster images to vectorized shapefiles, providing a versatile approach to representing geospatial data.
